Post-Turing machine

1936 Post

tape, binary boxes {mark/slash, empty}
numbered set of instructions 1,2,3,...,n
begin at instruction 1
"worker" operations:
(a) Marking the box he is in (assumed empty),
(b) Erasing the mark in the box he is in (assumed marked),
(c) Moving to the box on his right,
(d) Moving to the box on his left,
(e) Determining whether the box he is in, is or is not marked.
the ith direction is one of
A perform operation O[a|b|c|d] and then follow direction j[i]
B perform operation Oe and for yes/no follow j[i]' / j[i]''
C stop
no sequential execution

Turing 5-tuples to 4-tuples
q0,inp,q1,print,move ->
q0,inp,q1,print|move

1954, 1957 Wang

write 0
write 1
move left
move right
if scanning 0 then goto instruction i
if scanning 1 then goto instruction j
sequential execution is assumed
stop by running out of instructions

1974 Davis-1

binary {1, 0}

PRINT 1
PRINT 0
GO RIGHT
GO LEFT
GO TO STEP i IF 1 IS SCANNED
GO TO STEP i IF 0 IS SCANNED
STOP

steps are positive numbers (absolute addresses)
a blank tape is all zeroes

1994 Davis-Sigal-Weyuker

multiple tape alphabet (reduces to binary with blank = 0)
B means blank

PRINT σ ;Replace scanned symbol with σ
IF σ GOTO L ;IF scanned symbol is σ THEN goto "the first" instruction labelled L
RIGHT ;Scan square immediately right of the square currently scanned
LEFT ;Scan square immediately left of the square currently scanned

P, E, L, R: tape action (exec PELR), then table action (next instr)

J0, J1: tape action (lookup), then table action (goto xxx or next instruction)

J : tape action (lookup), then table action (goto xxx or goto xxx)

jump instructions: (J0 / J1), (J1 / J), (J0, J), or (J0 / J1 / J)
