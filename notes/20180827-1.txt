FST:

A: alphabet for tape 1

B: alphabet for tape 2

Q: set of states

T: set of transition rules Q x (A + Îµ) -> P(Q x B*)

above is a family of transducers indexed by s in S

S: set of start states

F: set of final states


relations:

reflective: xRx

symmetric: xRy -> yRx

transitive: xRy and yRz -> xRz

equivalence: all three


operations:

kleene: accepts concatenation of S0 .. SN

optional: accepts S or the empty string

union: accepts a string that is accepted by either M1 or M2

intersect: accepts a string that is accepted by both M1 and M2

difference: accepts a string that is accepted by M1 but not by M2

concatenate: accepts a string that consists of two parts, one accepted by M1 and one by M2
