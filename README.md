# automata-as-tools
Experiments with making tools based on different classes of automata/abstract machines.

*Actually, the tool-making part is less relevant at the moment, but I think it will resurface.*

Mostly done, I think:

* Finite state machine (automaton/transducer)

Doing

* Push-down automaton
* Post-Turing machine
* (Basic) Turing machine

Prospective

* Karel robot
* Register machine
