state transition engine:
	partial function δ : S × A → S or δ : S × A → P(S)

event response engine ("output"):
	entry		s → e fires when current state set to s (move *,s)
	exit		s → e fires when current state changes from s (move s,*)
	move		s0,s1 → e fires when current state changes from s0 to s1
	transition	s,a → e fires when transition is state s and symbol a
